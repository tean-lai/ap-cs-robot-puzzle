This is a project that I made as one of my projects for AP Computer Science Principles, a course I took in high school. The assignment was to write a program that will allow the user to control a "robot" with WASD controls in a grid, that's robot.py.

robotPuzzle.py on the other hand, is like a fun puzzle minigame! It's inspired by the puzzle that, SPOILERS, you need to solve to obtain the Master Sword in the Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess. Instead of controlling one robot, this time, two robots will simultaneously move in opposite directions with each action you make! The goal is to manipulate the two at the same time to somehow land on the target grid. It may sound a bit confusing at first if you haven't played the Zelda game, but it's actually kind of simple, just try it out by running robotPuzzle.py!
