# simple-robot-puzzle
This is a project that I made as one of my projects for AP Computer Science Principles, which is a course I took when I was a freshman in high school. The assignment was to write a program that will allow the user to control a "robot" with WASD controls in a grid, that's robot.py.

robotPuzzle.py on the other hand, is like a fun puzzle minigame! It's inspired by the puzzle that you need to solve to obtain the Master Sword in the Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess. How this puzzle works is that, similar to robot.py, WASD controls let you move a robot up, down, left, or right. However, this time each action will move two robots at once! The goal is to control the two at the same time two somehow land on the target grid. It may sound a bit confusing at first if you haven't played the Zelda game, but it's actually kind of simple, just try it out by running robotPuzzle.py!
